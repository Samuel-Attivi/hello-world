My name is Samuel Attivi an aspiring Data scientist, who is currently undertaking a course with ALX (African Leadership Experience) whose aim is to become a Machine Learning Engineer at the end of the fourteen-month program. I am currently on the Python module and by next week I will be taking an examination to test my knowledge of what I have learnt so far, then, I will delve into regression, which entails building models. Python has been very demanding with the learning of functions, recursive and lambda functions, DataFrame, Numpy and Statistics.
